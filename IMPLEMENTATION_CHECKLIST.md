# ✅ Implementation Checklist

Use this checklist to get your package ready for publishing TODAY!

## 📁 Step 1: Create Project Structure (5 minutes)

```bash
# Create the Flutter package
flutter create --template=package flutter_motion_ui

cd flutter_motion_ui
```

## 📝 Step 2: Copy All Files (10 minutes)

Copy these files from the artifacts into your project:

### Core Files
- [ ] `pubspec.yaml` → Root directory
- [ ] `README.md` → Root directory
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` → Root directory
- [ ] `LICENSE` → Root directory

### Library Files (lib/ folder)
- [ ] `lib/flutter_motion_ui.dart` (main export)
- [ ] `lib/src/buttons/motion_button.dart`
- [ ] `lib/src/buttons/gradient_button.dart`
- [ ] `lib/src/cards/motion_card.dart`
- [ ] `lib/src/cards/glassmorphic_card.dart`
- [ ] `lib/src/lists/animated_list_item.dart`
- [ ] `lib/src/toasts/modern_toast.dart`
- [ ] `lib/src/navigation/awesome_bottom_nav.dart`
- [ ] `lib/src/bottom_sheets/motion_bottom_sheet.dart`
- [ ] `lib/src/animations/slide_animation.dart`
- [ ] `lib/src/animations/scale_animation.dart`
- [ ] `lib/src/animations/fade_animation.dart`
- [ ] `lib/src/utils/motion_config.dart`

### Example App
- [ ] `example/lib/main.dart`
- [ ] `example/pubspec.yaml` (update with your package)

## 🔧 Step 3: Update Configurations (5 minutes)

### In `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
# Update these fields:
homepage: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flutter_motion_ui
repository: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flutter_motion_ui
issue_tracker: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flutter_motion_ui/issues
```

### Create `analysis_options.yaml`:
```yaml
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  rules:
    - prefer_const_constructors
    - prefer_const_literals_to_create_immutables
```

### Update `example/pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
name: flutter_motion_ui_example
description: Example app for Flutter Motion UI

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_motion_ui:
    path: ../
```

## 🧪 Step 4: Test Everything (10 minutes)

```bash
# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Analyze code
flutter analyze

# Run example app
cd example
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Quick Manual Tests:
- [ ] Tap all buttons - animations work?
- [ ] Scroll the list - stagger animation?
- [ ] Show toast - appears and dismisses?
- [ ] Open bottom sheet - slides smoothly?
- [ ] Tap bottom nav - transitions work?
- [ ] Test on iOS simulator (if available)
- [ ] Test on Android emulator

## 🌐 Step 5: Setup GitHub (5 minutes)

```bash
# Initialize git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Flutter Motion UI v1.0.0"

# Create repo on GitHub, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flutter_motion_ui.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Add to GitHub repo:
- [ ] Description: "Beautiful UI components with motion animations for Flutter"
- [ ] Topics: flutter, dart, ui, animation, material-design, widgets
- [ ] Website: Link to pub.dev (after publishing)

## 📦 Step 6: Pre-Publish Check (5 minutes)

```bash
# Back to root directory
cd ..

# Dry run (checks for issues)
flutter pub publish --dry-run
```

### Fix any issues:
- [ ] All files present?
- [ ] No errors in analysis?
- [ ] Description long enough (60+ chars)?
- [ ] Example app works?
- [ ] License included?

## 🚀 Step 7: PUBLISH! (2 minutes)

```bash
# Publish to pub.dev
flutter pub publish
```

1. Sign in to Google account
2. Confirm package details
3. Accept terms
